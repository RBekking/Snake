# Snake
Classic snake game from the Chilli Tutorial on Youtube (with some stuff of my own). 
I'm practicing my OO skills with this one.

## Features:
- Object Oriented Design
- Buffered input
- Smooth movement
- Color changes depending on level
- Cool die-animation
- Progress bar
- Final food-item twinkels randomly

## Known issues:
- Cannot grow beyond 100 segments. Updating to use heap instead of stack for storing segments object.
